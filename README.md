# Short presentation

This project is created by following the curriculum available from The Odin Project (TOP).

More information about TOP can be found at the [following link](https://www.theodinproject.com/about).

Topics that personally have managed to cover from this curriculum until now:
- writing clean and meaningful Git commit messages
- basic HTML (boilerplate, working with lists, links)
- working with CSS (basic properties)
- box model (block vs inline vs inline-block)

Currently this project is a work in progress and I'm really looking forward to learning more. :)


# Commit Naming Convention

To maintain a clean and structured commit history, follow this convention when making commits:

### Format:

### Commit Types:
- **feat** → Implementing a new feature
- **fix** → Fixing a bug
- **style** → Styling changes (spacing, colors, typography)
- **refactor** → Code restructuring (folder layout, reorganizing CSS/HTML)
- **docs** → Adding or updating documentation

Currently in a primitive state - this will likely be updated later down the road.
