        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This banana cake is one of the easiest cakes we've ever made. Ever. You can make this banana cake plain, or use it as a starting point. Add nuts, dried fruit, chocolate chunks, spices too.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 very ripe medium bananas</li>
            <li>3 large free-range eggs</li>
            <li>100g soft light brown sugar</li>
            <li>150ml sunflower or vegetable oil</li>
            <li>275g white self-raising flour</li>
            <li>1 tsp ground mixed spice</li>
            <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
        </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4 and grease and line a 900g/2lb loaf tin with baking parchment or use a loaf tin liner.</li>
            <li>Peel the bananas and mash with a fork. Tip into a large mixing bowl and add the eggs, sugar and oil. Use a fork or whisk to combine.</li>
            <li>Add the flour, spice and baking powder and whisk together until thoroughly combined. Pour into the prepared tin. Bake for 40 minutes, or until the cake is well risen and a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean.</li>
            <li>Cool in the tin for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack. Serve warm or cold in slices. Spread with butter if you like.</li>
        </ol>
